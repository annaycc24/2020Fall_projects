# Contribution
We worked together via zoom discussion and each of us handled one hypothesis.

# Research Background
During the covid-19 pandemic, wearing a mask is recommended or required in many countries. Since influenza has a very similar way of spreading, we want to know how the masks could influence the spreading of influenza. Intuitionally, people tend to take off the masks if the increase of new cases of covid-19 could slow down, but this might affect the spreading of influenza. The datasets were obtained from WHO and Google Trend which could help us find the relationship between the covid-19 and influenza.
