# Contribution
We worked together via zoom discussion and each of us handled one hypothesis. We collected data and completed doctests together.
- Cheng-Chen Yang:  
Extracted the information we need from the specific data to a new data frame.
- Vivian Liao:  
Loaded data of flu cases, covid cases, and mask searching trend to the file, and made the plots for the hypothesis 2.
- Enshi Wang:   
Collected data and made the plots for hypothesis one and hypothesis three.

# Research Background
During the covid-19 pandemic, wearing a mask is recommended or required in many countries. Since influenza has a very similar way of spreading, we want to know how the masks could influence the spreading of influenza. Intuitionally, people tend to take off the masks if the increase of new cases of covid-19 could slow down, but this might affect the spreading of influenza. The datasets were obtained from WHO and Google Trend which could help us find the relationship between the covid-19 and influenza.

# Hypothesis
1) During the pandemic, the global influenza cases may decrease, because people wear face masks everywhere.  
2) In countries where the COVID-19 is abating, the confirmed cases of influenza may be increased, since people start not to wear face masks.  
3) The peak of the spread of influenza may delay due to the pandemic since people wear masks.

# Conclusion
- Hypothesis 1:  
The flu cases from each country during the pandemic are lower than the previous year. In the previous year, the mask search trend did not change a lot, so the flu cases were more related to the weather.
In 2020, although they still seem like related to the weather, we can check the flu cases in the beginning of the year.
Apparently, when the mask searching trend goes up, the flu cases decrease obviously.  
  
- Hypothesis 2:  
From the plot based on China’s influenza and COVID data in 2020, we can see that although the COVID-19 is abating, the influenza case does not increase.
It may because people are still aware of the pandemic outside their country.  
  
- Hypothesis 3:  
We used the data from UK, US and China from 2015-2020. We found that we cannot 
study the peak month since the peak occurs in winter but we do not have these data for the year of 2020.
We then studied  the influence of masks to the influenza, we compared the number of influenza cases
among the historical data. We found that the number of cases decreases earlier with masks in 2020. In the three countries, the number of 
new cases decreased to 0 in April,  which is 3 months earlier than normal in the US; 2 months earlier 
than normal in UK; and also the earliest month in China among the years we studied.  The finding strongly indicates 
that masks could shorten the duration of influenza, which is a positive evidence to support our hypothesis.
