# Contribution
We worked together via zoom discussion and each of us handled one hypothesis. We collected data and completed doctests together.
- Cheng-Chen Yang:  
Extracted the information we need from the specific data to a new data frame.
- Vivian Liao:  
Loaded data of flu cases, covid cases, and mask searching trend to the file, and made the plots for the hypothesis 2.
- Enshi Wang:   
Collected data and made the plots for hypothesis one and hypothesis three.

# Research Background
During the covid-19 pandemic, wearing a mask is recommended or required in many countries. Since influenza has a very similar way of spreading, we want to know how the masks could influence the spreading of influenza. Intuitionally, people tend to take off the masks if the increase of new cases of covid-19 could slow down, but this might affect the spreading of influenza. The datasets were obtained from WHO and Google Trend which could help us find the relationship between the covid-19 and influenza.

# Hypothesis
1) During the pandemic, the global influenza cases may decrease, because people wear face masks everywhere.  
2) In countries where the COVID-19 is abating, the confirmed cases of influenza may be increased, since people start not to wear face masks.  
3) The peak of the spread of influenza may delay due to the pandemic since people wear masks.
